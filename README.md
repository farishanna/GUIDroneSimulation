# GUIDroneSimulation

## A GUI Drone Simulation using JavaFX libraries

This project will need a JavaFx setup, including SceneBuilder. This project was done on eclipse.

The following application is a drone simulator where it shows a canvas screen where you can add multiple types of drones.
There are three types of drones:
  1. A friendly drone: This drone just moves around the screen.
  2. A healer drone: This drone does not move, and if a friendly drone collides with one, it would grow the friendly drone.
  3. An enemy drone: This drone will shrink the friendly drones until they are gone, and will shrink itself if collided with a healer drone.
  
  You can add as many types of drones as you wish, you can pause the simulation or save it for later.
